--ZEPTO Project--

1. Open pgAdmin/MySQL and create a database. 
2. Under that new database create a table called Zepto. We'll be using this table for all our operations.

Code:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Zepto;
CREATE TABLE ZEPTO(
	sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	Category VARCHAR(120),
	name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
	mrp NUMERIC(8,2),	
	discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
	availableQuantity INT,
	discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),	
	weightInGms INT,
	outOfStock BOOLEAN,
	quantity INT
);

Execute this code.

3. Now, import data in this table we created as UTF8(save the dataset as UTF8 if its not working).
4. Now lets perform some Exploratory Data Analysis functions.

--Exploratory Functions

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Zepto;
SELECT * FROM Zepto;

A. Types of cateogries

SELECT DISTINCT category 
FROM ZEPTO
ORDER BY category;

B. products in stock vs out of stock

SELECT outofstock, COUNT(*)
FROM Zepto
GROUP BY outofstock;

C. product names present multiple times 

SELECT 
	name, 
	COUNT(*) AS no_of_Sku
FROM Zepto
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY no_of_Sku DESC;

Now that we've performed the surface level data exploration, lets move to data cleaning and transformation.

5. Lets perform some data cleaning functions

--Data Cleaning

A. Products with Price = 0, As price=0 is not a legitimate entry for a product in the database

SELECT 
	* 
FROM Zepto
WHERE
	mrp = 0
	OR
	discountedsellingprice = 0;

DELETE FROM Zepto
WHERE mrp=0;

B. Converting into standardized units i.e From Paise to Rupees, As we must convert the numeric figures into actually usable quantities/formats.

UPDATE Zepto
	SET 
		mrp = mrp/100.0,
		discountedsellingprice = discountedsellingprice/100.0;

SELECT mrp, discountedsellingprice FROM Zepto;

6. Now, lets perform some business related queries and analysis

Q1. Find the top 10 best-value products based on the discount percentage.

Code:

SELECT * FROM Zepto;

SELECT 
	name, 
	discountpercent
FROM Zepto
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;

Q2. What are products with high MRP but out of stock.

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT
	name, 
	mrp
FROM Zepto
WHERE 
	outofstock = TRUE 
	AND mrp > 300
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Q3. Calculate estimated potential revenue for each product category

Code:

SELECT
	category,
	SUM(discountedsellingprice * availablequantity) AS Total_Revenue
FROM Zepto
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;

Q4. Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

Code:

SELECT 
	name,
	mrp,
	discountpercent
FROM Zepto
WHERE 
	mrp > 500
	AND 
	discountpercent < 10
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 3 DESC;

Q5. Identify top 5 categories offering highest average discount percentage.

Code:

SELECT 
	category,
	ROUND(AVG(discountpercent), 2) AS avg_disc_percent
FROM Zepto
GROUP BY category
LIMIT 5;

Q6. Calculated price per gram for products above 100gm and sort by best value.

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT 
	name, 
	weightingms,
	discountedsellingprice,
	ROUND(discountedsellingprice/weightingms, 2) AS price_per_gm
FROM Zepto
WHERE weightingms > 100
ORDER BY 4 DESC;

Q7. Group the products into categories like low, medium, bulk

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT 
	name,
	weightingms,
	CASE WHEN weightingms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
		 WHEN weightingms < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
		 ELSE 'Bulk'
	END AS Weight_Category
FROM Zepto;

Q8. What is total inventory weight per product category 

Code:

SELECT 
	category,
	SUM(weightingms * availablequantity) AS Total_Weight
FROM Zepto
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY Total_Weight DESC;

7. With that we're done with the business related analysis.
